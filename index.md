## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hello! My name is {{ site.name }}. I'm from Brooklyn, New York, and I am a sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I am motivated by consistency and growth. Whether I’m learning new tools like 3D modeling or taking time each day to focus on personal goals, I believe that steady progress builds long-term success. 

Beyond academics, I value building relationships and contributing to communities. I currently am a Corporate Committee member for the American Society of Mechanical Engineers at Cornell. I hope to foster an inclusive and encouraging atmosphere, connecting mechanical engineers together. My prior experiences as a youth counselor and chess tournament director cultivated my leadership skills and shaped my belief of the importance of an inclusive learning environment. Just as I strive for consistency in my own development, I aim to create spaces where others can progress steadily, build confidence, and discover new skills.

In my free time I enjoy drawing, chess, watching anime, and playing video games. The Legend Of Zelda is my favorite video game series!
