This project investigates the performance of a water-to-water heat exchanger and analyzes how its effectiveness changes under different flow configurations and operating conditions. The system consists of two independent water loops—one hot and one cold—circulating through separate channels of the heat exchanger. Heat is transferred across a thermally conductive metal wall, allowing energy to flow from the hot stream to the cold stream without mixing the fluids.

To evaluate how design choices influence performance, we experimentally tested parallel-flow and counterflow configurations, as well as varying the relative mass flow rates of the two streams. Temperature measurements at the inlets and outlets of each stream were used to perform energy balances, determine heat-transfer rates, and compute heat-exchanger effectiveness. The results demonstrate how flow arrangement and flow-rate mismatch alter the temperature profiles, heat capacity rates, and ultimately the thermal performance of the exchanger.
