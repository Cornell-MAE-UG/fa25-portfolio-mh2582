For a class, we were asked to design a space of 150cm by 50cm that contained a rigid bar of a fixed length of our choice, a linear actuator, and 3 pins that connected the components to each other and the ground. The actuator was chosesn from an online catalog, where we were given the dimensions and forces that different models of actuators can produce. 

The main goal of this task was to design a mechanism that lifts the maximum possible weight to the highest location without tipping over (in equilibrium).
