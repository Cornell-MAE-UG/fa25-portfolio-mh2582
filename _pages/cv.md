- **Programming:** Python  

---

#### Projects
- **Mechanism Design**:  
  *Designed a 150 cm × 50 cm space containing a rigid bar of fixed length, a linear actuator, and three pins connecting the components to each other and the ground. The objective was to create a mechanism that could lift the maximum possible weight to the highest position without tipping over, using actuator specifications from an online catalog.*  
  - Maximum weight for the setup: 10.81kN  
  - Maximum hieght: 50cm (same as the design space height)  

- **Reddit CMV Thread Analyzer - CS1110 (Python)**:  
  *Developed a Python script to analyze Reddit threads from the "ChangeMyView" subreddit, parsing JSON data to identify delta awards and measure user persuasion patterns.*  
  - Found that henge words, such as "would", "could", "believe", are more frequent in non-persuasive comments. In contrast, persuasive comments show a slightly higher use of tentative but confident markers like "maybe" and "usually", possibly reflecting a balance between confidence and openness.
  - Traversed nested comment trees recursively to track delta eligibility, validating award conditions from the thread’s JSON data
